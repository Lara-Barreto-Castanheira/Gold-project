# Gold - WorldWideGold Analysis Report
## Overview
WorldWideGold is a logistics company specializing in the gold supply chain, from mining to trading. Our current project focuses on analyzing data patterns to optimize trading strategies and identify profitable business scenarios. The analysis encompasses mining records, gold pricing trends, and the relationship between supply and price over the last decade.

## Project Summary
### 1. Mining Data Analysis

  We collected mining records by year and tonnage over the past decade.
  Early in the decade, Canada and the USA were major gold producers.
  Recent trends show significant growth in gold mining from Asian countries.
  Key current gold-producing countries include China, Russia, Australia, the USA, and South Africa.
  
### 2. Gold Pricing Trends

Analysis of gold prices in US Dollars reveals notable declines in 2014, 2016, and 2019, making gold trading in the US particularly advantageous during these periods.

In the Eurozone, a similar drop in gold value occurred in 2016. However, Europe experienced a significant decline between 2012 and 2013, whereas prices remained high in the US during that time.

### 3. Supply vs. Price Relationship

Our data indicates that 71% of the time, gold prices move in tandem with supply levels.

There are deviations in 28% of cases, with 2019 exhibiting a particularly explosive deviation between gold's price and supply.


## Key Insights

Mining Dynamics: The shift in major gold producers from North America to Asia reflects changing dynamics in the global mining sector.

Price Trends: Periodic drops in gold prices offer strategic trading opportunities, especially during significant declines in both the US and Eurozone.

Supply and Price: While gold prices generally align with supply, occasional deviations, especially dramatic ones like in 2019, present unique trading challenges and opportunities.
